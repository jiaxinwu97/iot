# Learning Statement

## Goals for the course:
1.	Create a portfolio piece that demonstrates my interests as well as my capabilities in integrating design and engineering elements. 
2.	Get to know how design goals translate into engineering processes and requirements. More specifically, learn about front-end approaches and practices that reveal the potential of IOT for future projects.
3.	Get experienced on a variety of tools, including debugging and working ways around obstacles.

## Skills
1.	Manufacturing / Prototyping e.g. CAD, soldering
2.	Coding 
•	I want to know my way around how to build a thing. Instead of the theoretical or conceptual “how-to”, I want to get into the specifics and details. Though I may not get to use every tool, I want to learn as many ways one goal can be implemented as possible in case the other should be compromised.
