# Project Proposal
## Goal
The project aims to build an IOT device to help young children learn how to brush their teeth properly. Those are important life habits that should be well formed at young. 
The device shall be interactive and appeal to young children in form. It will borrow gamification concepts and encourage children to play with it, instead of acting as a monitor. 
Given the time that such tasks are usually performed (morning and night), the device should also be attentive to the child's mood and guide them to be focused or relaxed. 
## Composition
The device should be a decorative portable mirror. Mirrors are an important piece in the bathroom and people stare into the mirror anyway during brushing their teeth. Children will have their own mirror to use because it suits their size and the additional functions do not interfere with other uses. Screens and physical displays integrated into the mirror will show the 
A rotating stand keeps the childâ€™s toothbrush and toothpaste safe, also communicating to the mirror when to start. It may be extended to other purposes as well. 
## The atmosphere
The device shall play music to better engage the child. The music should be energizing or happy or the morning session, and soothing for the night. 
## Intelligence
Some children may not brush their teeth properly. Data shall be collected on their movement and parents will be able to view synthesized results on how well the child is brushing teeth. Relevance must be established in advance regarding movement and force.
Parents will also be notified if their children miss a session. 
## Gamification
For children 2-3, show a set of teeth and a familiar cartoon character attempting to clean it. As the child moves the toothbrush, the cartoon character moves as well and cleans the teeth. 
For children 4-6, use tooth brush as a control to move the character through a maze and reach the destination.  
For children >6, be more educative and show fun facts to keep the child engaged and brush teeth for a certain length of time.
