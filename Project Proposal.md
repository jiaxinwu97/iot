## Goal
The project aims to build an IOT device to help young children learn how to brush their teeth properly. Those are important life habits that should be well formed at young. 
Instead of focusing on the cleaning ability of the toothbrush, such as the vibrating frequency or angle, I would like to explore how the IOT device may help users become better people. The device will help the children become recognize the importance of their teeth and guide them to be responsible for their own well-being. 
The device shall be interactive and appeal to young children in form. It will borrow gamification concepts and encourage children to play with it, instead of acting as a monitor. 
Given the time that such tasks are usually performed (morning and night), the device should also be attentive to the child's mood and guide them to be focused or relaxed. 
## Composition
### Mirror
The device should be a decorative portable mirror. Mirrors are an important piece in the bathroom and people stare into the mirror anyway during brushing their teeth. Children will have their own mirror to use because it suits their size and the additional functions do not interfere with other uses. Screens and physical displays integrated into the mirror will show the guidance and entertainment. The use of acrylic two-way mirrors can allow displays be seen on top of the mirror. A tablet will be too costly for this project, but some kind of other screen will do the work, should I limit the displays. 
### Stand
A rotating stand/ ferris wheel stand keeps the childâ€™s toothbrush and toothpaste safe, also communicating to the mirror when to start. It may be extended to other purposes as well. 
The combined product may look something like this: a mirror stacked beside the storage wheel. 
### Toothbrush
The toothbrush does not need to be electrical, but should have sensors to tell how much force the child is pushing on his teeth, and what part of teeth he is brushing (refer to Oral-B IO). For better guidance, the toothbrush might even need sensors for mouth-modeling (refer to Colgate Plaqless Pro). Or, accelerometer can help establish 3D-motion analysis and identify what moves the child is making (refer to Aquasonic Brush Monster).
## The atmosphere
The device shall play music to better engage the child. The music should be energizing or happy or the morning session, and soothing for the night. 
## Intelligence
Some children may not brush their teeth properly. Data shall be collected on their movement and parents will be able to view synthesized results on how well the child is brushing teeth. Relevance must be established in advance regarding movement and force.
Parents will also be notified if their children miss a session. 
## Designing for kids
The product must be simple and intuitive to use, without having to learn a lot. It will give instant feedback and use a story to guide the child through the whole process. Visuals and colors are important.
